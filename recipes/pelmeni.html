    <h2>Description</h2>
    <p>
        Pelmeni are traditional Russian meat-filled dumplings. 
        Making pelmeni is favorite family pastime in the long winter months. 
        These dumplings are a common convenience food - big batches can be frozen and quickly boiled or fried on demand.

        <li>1 teaspoon salt</li>
        <li>¾ cup warm water</li>
        <li>3 cups all-purpose flour </li>
        <li>1 tablespoon all-purpose flour</li>
    </ul>
    <strong>Filling:</strong>
    <ul>
        <li>18 ounces ground beef</li>
        <li>1 small onion, chopped</li>
        <li>1 ½ tablespoons ice-cold water</li>

    <h2>Steps</h2>
        <ol>
            <li>
                <p>
                    Combine egg, vegetable oil, and salt in a measuring cup; add enough water to fill to 1 cup. 
                    Pour into a bowl, add 3 cups flour, and knead into a smooth, elastic dough. 
                    Cover with a kitchen towel and rest for 30 minutes.

                <p>
                    Dust a baking sheet lightly with 1 tablespoon flour.
                </p>
            </li>
            <li>
                <p>
                    Combine ground beef, onion, water, salt, and pepper in a bowl and mix filling thoroughly by 
                    hand or using a fork.
                </p>
            </li>
            <li>
                <p>
                    Roll out a portion of the dough very thinly on a lightly floured surface and cut out 2 1/2-inch 
                    rounds with a cookie cutter or a wine glass. Keep the rest of the dough covered with a towel to 
                    avoid drying out. Place 1/2 to 1 teaspoon of filling on one side of the dough circle. Fold dough 
                    over and seal the edges using fingers, forming a crescent. Join the ends and pinch them together. 
                    Place on the prepared baking sheet. Repeat with remaining dough and filling. Freeze pelmeni for 
                    30 minutes to prevent them from sticking together.
                </p>

                    Bring a large pot of lightly salted water to a simmer and drop small batches of frozen pelmeni 
                    into simmering water. Cook and stir until the meat is cooked and pelmeni float to the top, about 5 
                    minutes. Continue cooking for an additional 5 minutes. Transfer to serving plates using a slotted spoon.
