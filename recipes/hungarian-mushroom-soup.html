    <h2>Description</h2>
    <p>
        My family loves soup and this is one of their favorites. It has lots of flavor and is fairly quick to make. 
        It's primarily a mushroom soup but derives a lot of its flavor from other ingredients.  
    </p>
    <h2>Ingredients</h2>
    <ul>
        <li>4 tablespoons unsalted butter</li>
        <li>2 cups chopped onions</li>
        <li>1 pound fresh mushrooms, sliced</li>
        <li>2 teaspoons dried dill weed</li>
        <li>1 tablespoon paprika</li>
        <li>1 tablespoon soy sauce</li>
        <li>2 cups chicken broth</li>
        <li>1 cup milk</li>
        <li>3 tablespoons all-purpose flour</li>
        <li>1 teaspoon salt</li>
        <li>ground black pepper to taste</li>
        <li>2 teaspoons lemon juice</li>
        <li>¼ cup chopped fresh parsley</li>
        <li>½ cup sour cream</li>
    </ul>
    <h2>Steps</h2>

                    Melt the butter in a large pot over medium heat. Saute the onions in the butter for 5 minutes. Add 
                    the mushrooms and saute for 5 more minutes. Stir in the dill, paprika, soy sauce and broth. Reduce 
                    heat to low, cover, and simmer for 15 minutes.

                    In a separate small bowl, whisk the milk and flour together. Pour this into the soup and stir well 
                    to blend. Cover and simmer for 15 more minutes, stirring occasionally.

                    Finally, stir in the salt, ground black pepper, lemon juice, parsley and sour cream. Mix together 
                    and allow to heat through over low heat, about 3 to 5 minutes. Do not boil. Serve immediately.
