                        Place eggs in a saucepan and cover with water. Bring water to a boil. Cook 
                        eggs at a boil for 10 minutes. Remove eggs from hot water and set aside to cool.

                        Peel cooled eggs and cut into large chunks.

                        Melt butter in a skillet over medium heat. Fry egg chunks in melted butter until
